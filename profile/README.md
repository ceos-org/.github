A GitHub organization for the open documents and source code that CEOS (Committee on Earth Observation Satellites) publishes and maintains.

The original function of CEOS was to coordinate and harmonize Earth observations to make it easier for the user community to access and use data. CEOS initially focused on interoperability, common data formats, the inter-calibration of instruments, and common validation and inter-comparison of products. However, over time, the circumstances surrounding the collection and use of space-based Earth observations have changed.

In response to the changing environment, CEOS has evolved, becoming more complex and expanding the number and scope of its activities. In addition to its original charge, CEOS now focuses on validated requirements levied by external organizations, works closely with other satellite coordinating bodies (e.g. the Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites, CGMS), and continues its role as the primary forum for international coordination of space-based Earth observations.

Over the past four decades, CEOS has significantly contributed to the advancement of space-based Earth observation community efforts. The over 60 members and associates of CEOS communicate, collaborate, and exchange information on Earth observation (EO) activities, spurring useful partnerships and outputs that respond to stakeholder needs. CEOS played an influential role in the establishment and ongoing development of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Work Programme activities. CEOS, through major investments made by its member Agencies, continues to provide space-based data in support of civil Earth observation efforts worldwide.
